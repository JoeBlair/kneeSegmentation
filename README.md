## This repository contains the code used in my master project at the university of Copenahgen supervised by Christian Igel and Erik Dam, in collaboration with Biomediq.

The aim of this project was to compare 2D, 3D and pseudo-3D Convolutional Neural Networks for the semantic segmentaion of knee cartilage from MRI scans.
